There are **2 steps** to install Flojoy Studio:

## 1. Install Conda/Miniconda

If you haven't yet installed Conda/Miniconda on your machine,
please install it first. We are using it to manage the underlying Python
environment for all the magic behind Flojoy Studio. We also recommend
installing Miniconda since it is more lightweight.

You can find a detailed instruction [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).
And if you are comfortable of using command line, you can also find a quick
command line installation instruction [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html#quick-command-line-install).

## 2. Install Flojoy Studio

Once you have Conda/Miniconda installed on your machine, you are ready to install
Flojoy Studio. Simply choose the right installer for your machine and follow the
instructions.
